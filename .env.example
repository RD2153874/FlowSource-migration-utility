# FlowSource Migration Utility - Environment Configuration
# Only NODE_ENV is actually used by the migration utility itself

# Environment Configuration (used by Logger.js)
NODE_ENV=development

# Note: All other configuration is handled through:
# - Interactive Mode prompts (recommended)
# - CLI arguments
# 
# The migration utility does not require additional environment variables.
# Generated Backstage applications will have their own .env requirements.
